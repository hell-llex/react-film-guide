This is a test project on a Film Guide using React.

For the proper functioning of this project, it is recommended to use a VPN with a server, for example, in the Netherlands, as the API has been tested and confirmed to work with this server. However, it is also possible to use other servers.

Instructions for running:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory: `cd film-guide-react`.
4. Install dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
5. Start the application with the command: `npm dev`.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to the link provided by the Vite builder (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).

Now you can use the application to view movie information. Please remember to connect to a VPN for the API to work correctly.
